# Introduction

Welcome to the `Graasp Get Started with React App`! An initial project structure.
This `Get Started React App` has been developed for starters adoption. You can use it as much as you need, add small to big modifications. All links in the sections and this documentation will help you get started.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

This guide is divided into the following sections:

-    Forking the Starter Repository

-    Installing Dependencies

-    Starting the application

-    Code Style

-    Testing

-    Adding your own dependencies

-    Updating dependencies

-    Internationalization

# Labs

Labs are a special type of application that power the core learning component of Graasp. Labs usually refer to subject-specific simulations or virtual experiments that can be run on the browser or within Graasp's mobile application. Labs usually have pedagogical requirements, which are out of the scope of this guide, that should be clear before one starts developing a lab. For example, if you want to develop a lab to teach students about pH, you should have a good idea about how this is taught in a typical Chemistry class. Technically speaking, however, labs are simple web applications, usually involving only HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. In this section we explain how to get you started developing labs using JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular. Choose your preferred framework and start developing labs for education with this short guide.

## React

### Forking the Starter Repository

This is the quickest way to get started!
First, open the [graasp/react-get-started-app](https://github.com/react-epfl/graasp-app-starter-react) link in a new tab. On the top right of the repository, click fork. Then clone or download the cloned app from your own account.

> You can also just clone using SSH or HTTPS

```shell
  git clone git@github.com:your-username/graasp-app-starter-react.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

To install the application dependencies

1- Open your `Terminal`

2- Navigate to the cloned of downloaded project directory or folder

3- Run `yarn install`. But make sure you already have yarn installed on your development environment for this.

### Starting the application

To start your development server, run `yarn start` when all installations is completed and you're done.
This script executes a development server with force reloading enabled. Then your server keeps listening on all your modified files and reload your browser as well to apply changes an asynchronous way running on the port `3000` by default.

Then navigate to `localhost:3000` to preview your application running.


### Code Style

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. Normally, it is configured by default (you can see the configuration [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)). Once you installed it, by restarting your server, you will see all synthax issues rendered in the terminal as well as the browser console.

> In case you want to enforce a coding style, you can just use this tho disable eslint controls for a particular section or lines of code.

```javascript
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign <here include the eslint rule you want to disable, e.g. no-param-reassign>
```

### Testing

To run tests just execute `yarn test`. Note that the tests are also asynchronous. Then every time you save a file, the tests are re-run. You can read more about React testing [here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library).

### Internationalization

The starter app supports internationalization using the react-i18next library.

To add a new language to your app:

1- Add a language json file under `src/langs`. For example `de.json` for German.

2- Add your language translations using a key value pairs format. The key being the expression you use in your source code and the value beings its corresponding translation.  For example: "Welcome to the Graasp App Starter Kit": "Willkommen im Graasp App Starter Kit".

3- Import and add you language json to the react-i18next library under `src/config/i18n.js` by adding your language to the resources.

4- Add a language query string to your links to show the translated version of the app. For example: `http://localhost:3000/?mode=student&lang=de`.

5- To allow teachers and students to be able to change the language, a select box is available by default in the header. 

> You could remove this select box or include it in either the student or the teacher components by copying it along with the changeLanguage and colorStyles methods and editing the options array under `src/constants/langs` to add your new languages.

```javascript
  <Select
    styles={this.colorStyles}
    className="LanguageSelector"
    defaultValue={options[0]}
    options={options}
    value={selectedLanguage}
    onChange={this.changeLanguage}
  />
```


# API

# Authentication

Authentication is handled by the Graasp ecosystem. Apps hosted on the `graasp.eu` domain will receive
the cookie from the Graasp context they are running in.

So for example, an app running inside the Graasp Pages context will make requests to the API with the
cookie that it receives from the parent.

There are two types of users that we consider in the ecosystem and each is handled with its own cookie. 

##Â Graasp Users

Graasp users are those authenticated with their email via the `graasp.eu` platform. These are usually
the teachers or authors of spaces.

In the case of Graasp Pages, if you access a space from the `viewer.graasp.eu` subdomain, Graasp users
will be enforced.

## Light Users

Light users are those authenticated with a nickname, nickname and password combination, or anonymously.
Light users usually represent the learners, students or consumers of a space.

In the case of Graasp Pages, if you access a space from the `cloud.graasp.eu` subdomain, light users
will be enforced.

# App Instance

An app instance is a document that represents an instantiation of an app that has been configured to
run inside a space. App instances are linked to one user, but can be potentially accessed by users
with more permissions.

In order for an application to save data for a user, it needs to have an app instance. Inside an app
instance, an app can save its data. Similarly, with an app instance, a client can create resources
for it.

## Create

> In order to create an app instance you need to make a `POST` request to the following endpoint.

```
POST /app-instances
```

> Example `POST` request body.

```json
{
  "app": "5bd072b3532c3e058807decb",
  "data": {
    "modified": false,
    "progress": 0
  }
}
```

Creating a new `AppInstance` object is done via a `POST` request and takes the following arguments
inside of the body of the request.

**Arguments**

  - **app:** The string ID of the app, which corresponds to the app once it is configured.
  - **data:** An string, object, array or other structure you want to seed the app instance with.

## Read

> In order to fetch a specific `AppInstance` you need to make a `GET` request to the following
endpoint specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance` in question.

```
GET /app-instances/:id
```

> In order to fetch all of the `AppInstance` objects for a given app, you need to make a `GET`
request to the following endpoint, specifying the `appId` in question.

```
GET /app-instances?appId=:appId
```

You can fetch a specific `AppInstance` or all of the `AppInstance` objects of an app by performing
different types of `GET` requests.

## Update

> In order to update a specific `AppInstance` you need to make a `PATCH` request to the following
endpoint specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance` in question.

```
PATCH /app-instances/:id
```

> The body of your request should include the data with the **full** updated data. 

> Example `PATCH` request body.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "modified": true,
    "progress": 42
  }
}
```

You can update a specific `AppInstance` by performing a `PATCH` request and including the updated
parts of the `AppInstance` inside the request's body. For clients, the most important part to
consider is what is placed inside the `data` key, which is how clients handle the state of an
`AppInstance` that they want to persist.

<aside class="warning">
  If you do not pass the <strong>full</strong> data, you will override the <code>AppInstance</code>
  data <strong>without</strong> the ommitted information. 
</aside>

## Delete

To delete an app instance, you can send a `DELETE` request.

<aside class="warning">
  This request is final. You will not be able to recover the <code>AppInstance</code> after it has
  been deleted.
</aside>

> In order to update a specific `AppInstance` you need to make a `DELETE` request to the following
endpoint specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance` in question.

```
DELETE /app-instances/:id
```

# App Instance Resource

> This is an example `AppInstanceResource`:

```json
{
  "id": "5bd072b3532c3e058807aadf",
  "appInstanceId": "5bd072b3532c3e058807decb",
  "visibility": "private",
  "content": {
    "type": "review",
    "results": {
      "late": false,
      "grade": 96
    }
  }
}
```

An `AppInstanceResource` is a document or object created by an instance of an app that can be either
private to the app instance or public to any app running inside the space. 

Any client of the API can insert arbitrary content (i.e. whatever it wants) inside the `content` key.
This is limited to a bit less than 16MB by our database constraints.

## Create

> In order to create an `AppInstanceResource` you need to make a `POST` request to the following
endpoint, specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance`.

```
POST /app-instances/:id/resources
```

> Example `POST` request body.

```json
{
  "appInstanceId": "5bd072b3532c3e058807decb",
  "content": {
    "type": "plot",
    "points": [
      {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0
      },
      {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Creating a new `AppInstanceResource` object is done via a `POST` request and takes the following arguments
inside of the body of the request.

**Arguments**

  - **appInstanceId:** The string ID of the `AppInstance` creating the resource.
  - **content:** An string, object, array or other structure you want to store inside the resource.

The response sent from the server will include the location of the newly created resource.

## Read

> In order to fetch a specific `AppInstanceResource` you need to make a `GET` request to the
following endpoint specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance` and the `AppInstanceResource` in
question.

```
GET /app-instances/:appInstanceId/resources/:appInstanceResourceId
```

> In order to fetch all of the `AppInstanceResource` objects for a given `AppInstance`, you need to
make a `GET` request to the following endpoint, specifying the `appInstanceId` in question.

```
GET /app-instances/:appInstanceId/resources
```

> To fetch the **public** resources that have been created inside a given space, you perform the following
`GET` request.

> In order to fetch all of the *public* `AppInstanceResource` objects for a given `Space`, you need
to make a `GET` request to the following endpoint, specifying the `spaceId` in question.

```
GET /spaces/:spaceId/resources
```

> Example `GET` request for public resources in a space:

```
GET /spaces/1/resources?query={group:2}&select={result:1}
```

> If we assume that the public resources inside space `1` are the following:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "content": {
      "groupId": 1,
      "result": 78
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "content": {
      "groupId": 2,
      "result": 94
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "content": {
      "groupId": 2,
      "result": 99
    }
  }
]
```

> A `GET` request to the endpoint above would get all of the public resources for a given space that
have a key `group` inside the `content` object equal to `2`. It will return only key `results` from
inside the `content` key.

```json
[
  { "id": "2", "content": { "result": 94 } },
  { "id": "3", "content": { "result": 99 } } 
]
```
> Note that the `id` is returned by default unless specified as `{ id: 0 }` inside the `select`.

You can fetch a specific `AppInstanceResources`, all of the `AppInstanceResources` objects of an
`AppInstance` or all of the *public* `AppInstanceResources` in a space by performing different
types of `GET` requests.

The endpoints to fetch multiple `AppInstanceResource` objects support a query string with the
following options.

**URL Parameters**

  - `query`: A MongoDB-style **query** that we will run against the data inside the `content` key. 
  - `select`: A MongoDB-style **select** that we will run against the data inside the `content` key.

Both the `query` and the `select` options are intended to allow consumers of the API to filter and
project parts of the resources that have been saved for a given `AppInstance` or `Space`.

The endpoint to fetch a single resource also supports `select` query parameters mentioned above.

## Update

> In order to update a specific `AppInstanceResource` you need to make a `PATCH` request to the
following endpoint specifying the `id` of the `AppInstance` and the `AppInstanceResource` in
question.

```
PATCH /app-instances/:appInstanceId/resources/:resourceId
```

> The body of your request should include the data with the **full** updated content. 

> Example `PATCH` request body.

```json
{
  "content": {
      "type": "plot",
      "points": [
        {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0
        },
        {
          "x": 1,
          "y": 2
        },
        {
          "x": 2,
          "y": 4
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

You can update a specific `AppInstanceResource` by performing a `PATCH` request and including the
updated parts of the `AppInstanceResource` inside the request's body. For clients, the most
important part to consider is what is placed inside the `content` key, which is how clients handle
the state of an `AppInstanceResource` that they want to persist.

<aside class="warning">
  If you do not pass the <strong>full</strong> content, you will override the
  <code>AppInstance</code> content <strong>without</strong> the ommitted information. 
</aside>

## Delete

To delete an `AppInstanceResource`, you can send a `DELETE` request.

<aside class="warning">
  This request is final. You will not be able to recover the <code>AppInstanceResource</code>
  after it has been deleted.
</aside>

> In order to update a specific `AppInstance` you need to make a `DELETE` request to the following
endpoint specifying both the `id` of the `AppInstance` and of the `AppInstanceResource` in question.

```
DELETE /app-instances/:appInstanceId/resources/:resourceId
```

# Testing

You can test your apps' connection to our API locally using our development server. In order to do
this, you need to configure your `localhost` to  point to `apps.dev.graasp.eu`.

On most Linux and macOS machines you would have to edit the `/etc/hosts` file. On Windows machines this is achieved you edit the `hosts` file inside `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`.

In both cases, simply add the following line to the respective file:

```
127.0.0.1   apps.dev.graasp.eu
```
